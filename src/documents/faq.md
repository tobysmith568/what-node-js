## Is this website official?

No.  
It is not related to, or endorsed by, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or [the OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).

## Where does this website get it's information?

The same place that the [https://nodejs.org/about/releases/](https://nodejs.org/about/releases/) page gets it's information. There is [a JSON file](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/blob/main/schedule.json) in [the official Node.js Release Working Group repository](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) in the Node.js organization on GitHub.

This website gets that file when you load the page, so it's always up to date.

## Why "should" I use version X verses version Y?

On the [https://nodejs.org/about/releases/](https://nodejs.org/about/releases/) page, they explain that library authors _should_ use "Current" versions of Node.js to ensure that their library can support them. The page continues to say that "General use" and "Production apps" _should_ use LTS versions.

When this website suggests that you should use specific version, it's purely based on those premises. This website makes no original suggestions about what version best.
